# MCBE-Scott-CPU

This is a Minecraft(bedrock) adoptation of the famous Scott CPU in the book **_But How Do It Know? The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone_** and Compiler called the **_Gibberish Compiler_** I made of this CPU. 

__Get started [here](/Documents/get_started.md)__

## Project Structures
This project is split into two parts: 
* Gibberish Compiler
   * Exsist in this repo
* Minecraft World File of the actual Computer 
   * __File exsist in a subrepo called _[MCBE-Scott-CPU](https://github.com/YuandaLiu-Hashed/MCBE-Scott-CPU-World)_. It will be released in that repo.__
   * __Documentations will exsist in this repo.__

## Scott Computer Minecraft World
Note: the files of this Minecraft World exsists in a subrepo called _[MCBE-Scott-CPU](https://github.com/YuandaLiu-Hashed/MCBE-Scott-CPU-World)_ (only documentation of that project exsist in this repo).

This is a Minecraft adoptation of the famous Scott CPU in the book But how do it knows **_But How Do It Know? The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone_**.

The computer is binary compatible with the Scott CPU, with a modified IO port (see in the Documentations). 

It could be used as a teaching tool for teachers, or a gadget for someone like me to learn about computer architecture in a intuitive way. 

## Gibberish Compiler
This compiler is made to compile basic programs for the Minecraft Computer. 

![Example Image of a Multiplication Code](/Documents/images/image_000.png)

This program made by using [Processing](https://processing.org) which is a program made for learning Java (highly reconmemded if you want to start coding), this program can also be a example of a effective application made by Processing, which could used as a teaching and learning tool. 

Note: Java may need to be installed for this program to run.
