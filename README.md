This program made by using [Processing](https://processing.org) which is a program made for learning Java (highly reconmemded if you want to start coding), this program can also be a example of a effective application made by Processing, which could used as a teaching and learning tool. 

Note: Java may need to be installed for this program to run. 

## Scott Computer Minecraft World
Note: the files of this Minecraft World exsists in a subrepo called _[MCBE-Scott-CPU](https://github.com/YuandaLiu-Hashed/MCBE-Scott-CPU-World)_ (only the files, documents and releases is in this repo).
